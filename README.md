# Chinese-medicine-Data-extraction
Extract the data from a Chinese medicine textbook by Python
Due to confidential agreement, I can only upload the code. This code is only designed for the same version of the Chinese medicine textbook with the exact format, \
so it can only be used for the same version of textbook.

The outcome of the code is not the final version of the required extracted data.

The code is written in Jupyter Notebook, the viewer might have to use Jupyter Notebook to open it to see the unerrored code.

The code has 2 editions stored in two different cells, the one in the first cell is for the textbook in docx file format, the second one can be used directly to extract the texts in PDF format. however, the second one produces some errors in outcomes, so the code stored in the first one is chosen one to produce the outcomes you can find some distinctions bewtween two editions.
